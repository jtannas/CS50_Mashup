# CS50 Mashup
A mashup of data from a news RSS feed overlaid onto google maps markers (United States only).

This website came about from Problem Set 8 of Harvard's CS50X ([see here for the spec](http://docs.cs50.net/problems/mashup/mashup.html)).
It uses Python, Flask, javascript, jQuery, and AJAX.

This was made very early into my work with Python and Flask, so there's a lot that could be done better (i.e. docstrings instead of comment blocks, code tests, better use of templates, etc...). The effort to clean it up wouldn't be very productive or educational though, so I'll leave it pretty much 'as-is'.
